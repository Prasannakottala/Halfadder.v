# Halfadder.v
A Half adder used in binary Arithmetic. It adds two single bit binary numbers and produces sum &amp; carry. The sum output works on XOR operation, carry output works on AND operation i.e, means if two bits are 0 then the sum and carry also 0, if one bit is high the sum be 1 &amp; carry be 0, incase if two bits are high sum will be 0 and carry will be 1.
